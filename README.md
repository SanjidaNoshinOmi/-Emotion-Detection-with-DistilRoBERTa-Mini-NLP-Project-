üß† Emotion Detection with DistilRoBERTa (Mini NLP Project)

This is a beginner-friendly emotion detection tool built using Python and Hugging Face‚Äôs transformer model j-hartmann/emotion-english-distilroberta-base. It detects 27 nuanced emotions from any input text, such as joy, anger, pride, love, sadness, and many more.

üåü Why I Built This

After creating a simple Text Sentiment Analyzer, I wanted to explore how AI can not only detect emotions but also respond with different moods. It amazed me how machines can interpret various feelings in text and generate thoughtful responses. This project helped me understand the connection between emotion detection and meaningful interaction, which is a fascinating step toward building more human-like AI systems.

This project helped me learn how advanced models process language and emotions‚Äîan important step towards building smarter chatbots, mental health tools, and customer feedback analyzers.

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

    Input any sentence or text

    The model analyzes the text and predicts one of seven emotions: anger, happy, sad, disgust, neutral, fear, or surprise

    Based on the detected emotion and its confidence, the program provides a thoughtful response matching the mood for these 7         emotions only.
   

üë®‚Äçüíª Try It

Open the notebook in Google Colab, save a copy of the file in drive and run the `.ipynb` notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1yyoZZVZJSiD5kYklIN6vLMoH0S14Ovyo?usp=sharing). Then enter your own sentences, and see how the model understands and reacts to emotions in text. s!
